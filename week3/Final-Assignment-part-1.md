Brazilian steakhouse are world famous, but this goodness has it's price: concurrency

Even as Rio is a very big city, with 162 neighbouhoods, while the the most populous one has more than 300.000 citizens, the regions of the city are very diverse in every sense, including income.

&nbsp;
Meat is an expensive commoditie. Used not to be, as Brazil is one of the worlds production leaders, but recent rise in China imports (billed in us dolars) more attractive thanm internal market, so the locl prices  suffered a steep rise.

&nbsp;
That change represents a challenge to the steakhouses to maintain the same sells volume, and, still more than that, to expand and grow their leverage opening more filials.

&nbsp;
This is the objective of this research: to select the best neighbouhood to open a new steakhouse, taking in count both low concurrency and population income, as this business tipically has an expensive ticket, now more yet.
