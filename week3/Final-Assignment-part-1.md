Brazilian steakhouse are world famous, but this goodness has it's price: concurrency

Even as Rio is a very big city, with 162 neighbouhoods, while the the most populous one has more than 300.000 citizens, the regions of the city are very diverse in every sense, including income.

&nbsp;
Meat is an expensive commoditie. Used not to be, as Brazil is one of the worlds production leaders, but recent rise in China imports (billed in us dolars) more attractive than internal market, so the local prices suffered a steep rise, growing from US$25 to US$43 for the "arroba"(15Kg).

&nbsp;
That change represents a challenge to the steakhouses to maintain the same sells volume (and do not close filials and fire employers), and, above that, to expand and grow their leverage opening more filials. This became a real difficult and critical decision in the actual scenario for this market.

&nbsp;
The objective of this research is to select the best neighbouhood to open a new steakhouse, taking in acount both low concurrency and population income, as this business tipically has an expensive ticket, now more yet.
