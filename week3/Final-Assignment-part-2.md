The main idea is to investigate which neibourhoods has not a big steakhouse and at the same time has a high house income.

Foursquare does not has all the steakhouses in Rio, just the big branded ones, This is not a big problem to the sake of this resarch  as the idea is to serve as reference to the brands that already has many filials, and in this case small local restaurants does not offer the same experience and appeal that a parade of "infinite" amounts of sirloin cap, tenderloin, baby beef, slow roasted (12hs) whole ribs in "all you can eat" format.

I will use one data set and two APIs for this project:

-https://www.data.rio

This is the source of neighbourhood list and geometry. 


I saved in the csv file and selected just the names data.


-https://www.geocode.farm

This is for the latitude and longitude.

And, Foursquare for the venues discover, as required.

I have used some
