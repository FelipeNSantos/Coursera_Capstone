The main idea is to investigate which neibourhoods has not a big steakhouse and at the same time has a high house income.

Foursquare does not has all the steakhouses in Rio, just the big branded ones, This is not a problem to the sake of this resarch  as the idea is to serve as reference to the brands that already has many filials, and in this case small local concurrents does not offer the same experience and appeal.
